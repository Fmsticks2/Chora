Design Prompt: ChainGPT – Web3 Landing Page + Core Pages (HTML + CSS Based)
🧠 Project Overview
Design a modern Web3-style website for ChainGPT, an AI-powered cross-chain trading assistant built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). The landing page should blend futuristic AI vibes, DeFi utility, and crypto-native credibility, while remaining user-friendly and mobile responsive.

The site will be built using HTML and CSS only (possibly TypeScript later), so the design should favor clean code, modular CSS classes, and avoid frameworks (like Tailwind or Bootstrap).

✨ Style Direction
Visual Feel:

Sleek, minimal, modern

Futuristic with a touch of “cyberpunk” aesthetic

Inspired by AI dashboards and DeFi UIs

Uses gradients, soft shadows, glassmorphism, neon highlights, and dark/light mode toggle

Color Palette Suggestions:

Background: #0d1117, #1a1e29 (Dark Mode)

Accent: Electric Blue (#0ff), Violet (#9b59b6), Gradient greens (#00FFA3 to #DC1FFF)
