# ChainGPT Trading Companion - Development Prompt

## Project Overview
Build a revolutionary AI-powered cross-chain trading assistant on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that combines conversational AI with advanced DeFi capabilities. This platform will make complex multi-chain trading as simple as having a conversation while leveraging ICP's unique technical advantages.

## Core Product Vision
Create a chat-based trading companion where users can:
- Execute trades through natural language commands ("Buy $100 of BTC when it drops below $45k")
- Get AI-powered market analysis and predictions
- Manage cross-chain portfolios seamlessly
- Share and monetize trading strategies
- Access institutional-grade trading tools through simple conversation

## Technical Architecture Requirements

### 3. Trading & Transaction Logic

**Cross-Chain Trading Engine:**
- Utilize ICP's chain fusion technology for seamless cross-chain swaps
- Integrate with existing ICP DEXs (Sonic DEX, ICPSwap, Helix Markets)
- Implement Bitcoin integration using threshold signatures (t-ECDSA, t-Schnorr)
- Enable Ethereum interactions through EVM RPC canister
- Support chain-key tokens (ckBTC, ckETH) for cross-chain assets

**Smart Contract Architecture:**
- Design canisters for transaction handling and order management
- Implement escrow services for secure trading
- Create automated trading strategy execution
- Build portfolio tracking and rebalancing logic

### 4. Advanced Features

**AI-Powered Analytics:**
- Real-time market sentiment analysis
- Automated technical analysis and chart pattern recognition
- Risk assessment and portfolio optimization suggestions
- Predictive modeling for optimal entry/exit points

**Social Trading Elements:**
- Strategy sharing and discovery marketplace
- Follow successful traders and copy their strategies
- Community-driven trading insights and discussions
- Reputation system for strategy creators

**Automation Capabilities:**
- Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) automation
- Stop-loss and take-profit order management
- Rebalancing strategies based on market conditions
- Alert system for market opportunities
